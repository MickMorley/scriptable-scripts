# Importing Scripts

The app's way of importing scripts is that it accepts files `.scriptable` format. This is in essence a JSON file containing the script's code and metadata. If you receive a file in this format, you can simply share the file to Scriptable.

Most of the scripts shared by developers are in `.js` format,  usually containing the raw code of the script. This is how the Scriptable app stores scripts in its folder.

Scriptable can be used with or without iCloud. With iCloud, you will be able to see your script files in the Files app under the Scriptable folder.
Without iCloud, you can only see your script in the application.

## Importing with iCloud enabled

1. Download the `.js` file into the Scriptable folder in the Files app. The script will appear in the app after a few seconds.

## Importing without iCloud enabled

1. Copy the whole code into the clipboard.
2. Open the Scriptable app, tap the `+` icon at the upper-left corner of the screen.
3. Paste the code inside the blank area.
4. Tap the name at the top, normally called `Untitled Script`, then change it to the appropriate name. There's no need to include the `.js` extension.
